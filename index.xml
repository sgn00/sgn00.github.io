      <description>I am an undergraduate at National University of Singapore (NUS) studying computer science. My interest lies in information security where I have been involved in the offensive side through bug bounty and red teaming research. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m looking into cloud security.
In my free time, I enjoy reading and exploring new technologies.
